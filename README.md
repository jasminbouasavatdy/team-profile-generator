  ## Description
  This is a command-line application in which will generate an HTML page which will include your team which each team member added will show their name, role, id, email, either gitHub username, and or the school that they go to, depending on if you chose to create an engineer or and intern.

  ## Test
  To run the test for this application you would use the terminal and run an npm test. The test will let you know if your code is working correctly or not. In this case all of my tests pass, so you know that the application works.
